# unityZeldaDungeons
I'm practicing Unity by trying to recreate dungeons from the original Legend of Zelda for the NES.

All assets (sprites, maps, etc.) are originally property of Nintendo, I'm just using them to practice making games with Unity. I'm getting the sprites from https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/legendofzelda/
